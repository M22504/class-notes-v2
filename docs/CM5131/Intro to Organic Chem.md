## Stereoisomerism
### Optical Isomerism
<b>Enatiomers</b> are formed such that there is <b>NO</b> plane or center of symmetry. Otherwise, the compound is a <b>meso</b> compound. When two solutions of the same compound but with both existing as enatiomers of each other as mixed together, a <b>racemic</b> mixture is formed.

$$\require{mhchem}
\begin{array}{c}
\ce{\phantom{H_3}R_1}\\
| \\
\ce{R_2-C\text{*}-R_3}\\
| \\
\ce{R_4}
\end{array}$$

Here, \(R_1\), \(R_2\), \(R_3\), \(R_4\) are all different for chirality of C (represented by *) to be ensured.

### Geometric Isomerism
<b>Cis-Trans</b> Configurations is formed under <b>restricted bond rotation</b>, (C=C, Cyclic), with 2 different substituent groups on each carbon.

### Diastereomer
Basically optical isomerism, but 1 to \(n_* - 1\) bonds are chiral centres are mirrored, asumming \(n_* > 1\).
