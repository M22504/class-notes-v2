In the passage, Delistraty argues that “Working too much is at best, pointless, and at worst, actively harmful”. Considering global trends, to what extent do you believe that people should work less today? Your answer must refer to ideas raised in the passage as well as your own views and knowledge.

### I strongly agree
- Productivity, Efficiency reduces -> OECD
- Psychological, Physiological challenges -> health hazards, people start declining
- A BIT OF WORK STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE BUDDY BOY ->
