Agree?
- Activism has shown its roots in terms of its impact on modern culture. Historically, many activist movements led to great change. For instance,
	- #MeToo
	- War History lmao
- 



Disagree?
- Climate Activism often sidelines a major issue in America and worldwide today, that being the inaccountability of normal people. Even as people continue to vehemently protest against large conglomerates, they similarly adopt practices that they would be criticizing. As has been previously witnessed with the Big Tech scandals, especially those pertaining to Meta formerly Facebook, it is common practice for individuals to throw blame at a faceless corporation rather than accept that their actions continue to push on the very practices they are against. This is, in fact, basic human nature, and Cancel Culture has been a big catalyst behind this. The power of the media represents a seminal milestone in our economy, where "trial-by-media" is in fact a common practice. People can criticize anyone for having opposing opinions to them
- Negative repercussions of activism, post-#metoo semi-inflammatory comments
