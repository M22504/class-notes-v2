# Industry & Employment

## Global

### Recession

- The U.S. shed around **40 million jobs** at the peak of the pandemic. One group of  economists estimates that **42% of the jobs lost are gone forever.**

## Automation

- **Oxford Economics, a UK-based research firm**: Up to 20 million manufacturing jobs will be lost globally to robots by 2030.

#### Examples

The deployment of robots as a response to the coronavirus was rapid.  They were suddenly cleaning floors at airports and taking people’s  temperatures.

- Hospitals and universities deployed Sally, a salad-making robot created by tech company Chowbotics, to replace dining-hall  employees;
- Malls and stadiums bought Knightscope security-guard robots to patrol empty real estate.
- Companies that manufacture in-demand  supplies like hospital beds and cotton swabs turned to industrial robot supplier, Yaskawa America, to help increase production.

#### Government stance

- In the past, the U.S. responded to technological change by investing in  education.  And the idea of education in the U.S. still focuses on college for young workers rather than on retraining employees. The country spends 0.1% of GDP to help workers navigate job  transitions, less than half what it spent 30 years ago.
- The U.S. government incentivizes companies to automate, he says, by  giving tax breaks for buying machinery and software. A business that  pays a worker $100 pays $30 in taxes, but a business that spends $100 on equipment pays about $3 in taxes, he notes. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act lowered taxes on purchases so much that “you can actually make money buying equipment,” Acemoglu says.

### Work ethic

- According to data published by the International Labour Organisation  (ILO) in 2019, Asia has the longest average work-week. 
  - Three ASEAN countries are in the top 10, with Myanmar clocking 48  hours, Brunei, 47 and Malaysia, 46. 
  - Thailand and Singapore are in the top 20, with an average of 43 hours spent at work each week.

### Workspaces

- **Singapore**: Remote workspaces might lead to better productivity - Nanyang Technological University’s (NTU) Associate Professor Andy Ho said: “I think being able to meet on Zoom is actually not a bad thing, in a way that you can make sure that people actually are punctual. It's hard to be late on a Zoom meeting, you're home already, where else can you be?”
  - But it is “very different” from meeting in person – there is less brainstorming, and it can be more of a hindrance than a help, he added. “When everybody is together physically, it is easy to have a creative, dynamic session, whereas in a Zoom meeting, you really can’t speak over one another.”\
  - “41 per cent of workers in Singapore would rather continue working remotely than receive a bigger bonus, a survey by human resources solutions agency Randstad found

### Gig workers

- Grab would be laying off about [5 per cent of staff](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-grab-retrenches-5-per-cent-employees-severance-layoff-12839634) that really caught people by surprise in 2020.
