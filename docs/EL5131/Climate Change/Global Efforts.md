## Malicious

**Big Oil**: [Investigative reports](https://climateaccountability.org/pdf/Climate%20Accountability%20Rpt%20Oct12.pdf) by multiple activist organizations revealed Big Oil companies such as Exxon Mobil perpetuated falsehoods in climate science, and were long aware of the extent to which they were harming the environment since 1957.

- Report stoked public outrage resulting in protests and through #ExxonKnew

### Carbon Offsets

- [Summary](https://climateer.substack.com/p/avoided-emissions): Criticised for being a smokescreen that enables polluters, and doesn't help much with achieving net zero. 2 Types of offsets: Avoided emissions and Negative emissions.
  
  - **Examples**:
    
    - US Airline Jetblue funds solar/wind farms, forest protection, and landfill gas capture, because it can't just stop burning jet fuel
  
  - **Evaluating Offsets**: 
    
    - Additionality: Was anyone going to cut the tree in the first place?
    
    - Permanance: Is the forest going to be preserved forever?
    
    - Double-Counting: Landowner makes protection promizes to multiple companies
    
    - Leakage: If I can't cut this forest, cut that one instead

## Good ones

### Innovations

- Ocean shipping produces 2% of global emissions but hard to reduce while maintaining productivity. But startup FleetZero propose making use of large batteries to electrify ships, given how electric vehicles have broken into the mainstream consumer market.
