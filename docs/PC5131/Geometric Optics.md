# Geometric Optics
Welcome, to chapter 4 of PC5131 on Geometric Optics. This is basically the behaviour of light when passing through lenses, mirrors and the like. Remember your ray diagrams from Y1.
## Lenses

$$
\frac{1}{f} = \frac 1s + \frac 1{s'}
$$
$$
\text{Lens Maker's Equation: } \frac{1}{f} \approx (n-1)\bigg[\frac 1{R_1}-\frac 1{R_2}\bigg]
$$
## Convex Mirrors
## Concave mirrors
