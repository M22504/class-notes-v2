# Climate Change effects in Singapore

- 1980-2020: annual mean temperature rose from 26.9C to 28C
  
- 1980-2019: Annual rainfall increased at rate of 67mm per decade
  
- 2001: Typhoon Vamei swept north of Singapore, caused major flooding, tropical cyclones near equator could become more frequent
  

## Climate change risks in Singapore

- **Sea level**: Much of our nation lies only 15m above the mean sea level. 30% is less than 5m above it.
  
- **Water**: Drought test reliability of water supply, heavy rainfall overwhelms drainage and causes flash floods
  
- **Biodiversity and greenery**: self-explantory
  
- **Public health**: vector-borne diseases are observed during warmer periods of the year. Also makes heat stress more prevalent among the old and sick
  
- **Urban Heat Island Effect**: Replacement of natural land cover with infrastructure which produce/retain heat.
  

## Singapore's efforts

### Pledges

- 2009: Reduce emissions by 16% by 2020
  
- 2015: Reduce Emission Intensity (EI) (Amount of GHGs emitted per dollar GDP) by 36% from 2005 levels by 2030. Peak emissions by 2030
  

### Budget 2022

- Achieve net-zero by mid-century, in line with COP-26 in Nov 2021.
