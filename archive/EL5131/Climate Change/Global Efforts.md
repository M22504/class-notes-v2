# Global Efforts

## Malicious

**Big Oil**: [Investigative reports](https://climateaccountability.org/pdf/Climate%20Accountability%20Rpt%20Oct12.pdf) by multiple activist organizations revealed Big Oil companies such as Exxon Mobil perpetuated falsehoods in climate science, and were long aware of the extent to which they were harming the environment since 1957.

- Report stoked public outrage resulting in protests and through #ExxonKnew

## Not very good ones

### Carbon Offsets

- [Summary](https://climateer.substack.com/p/avoided-emissions): Criticised for being a smokescreen that enables polluters, and doesn't help much with achieving net zero. 2 Types of offsets: Avoided emissions and Negative emissions.
  
  - **Examples**:
    
    - US Airline Jetblue funds solar/wind farms, forest protection, and landfill gas capture, because it can't just stop burning jet fuel
  
  - **Evaluating Offsets**: 
    
    - Additionality: Was anyone going to cut the tree in the first place?
    
    - Permanance: Is the forest going to be preserved forever?
    
    - Double-Counting: Landowner makes protection promizes to multiple companies
    
    - Leakage: If I can't cut this forest, cut that one instead

## Good ones

### Innovations

- Ocean shipping produces 2% of global emissions but hard to reduce while maintaining productivity. But startup FleetZero propose making use of large batteries to electrify ships, given how electric vehicles have broken into the mainstream consumer market.

## Effectiveness of these efforts

- **Underdeveloped countries**: Behind on global environmental efforts although they often they face the brunt of the damage caused by climate change, especially island nations, and those near the tropics.
  
  - Carribean: Anomalous 30 Tropical storms in 2020; Pacific Islands: 3 Cyclones in 2020-2021. Uganda: Landslides (causing soil erosion, burying settlements, farms) and flooding more frequent.
  
  - Internation institute for Environment and Development (IIED) showed 46 of the world's least developed countries don't have finanical means to "climate proof" themselves. They need at least \$40bn a year, but between 2014-18, just \$5.9bn was delivered.
  
  - Under UN climate convention, EU & 23 developed countries pledges \$100bn a year to fund climate projects in developed nations. But Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) although \$80bn was made available in 2018, only 21% was used for adaptive
  
  - **Why are they behind in fighting climate change?**:
    
    - Immediate need to put food on table
    
    - Weak policy design, implementation and enforcement.
    
    - Not enough foreign financial aid.
