Chapter 2 of PC5131 is Waves... I. This is effectively singular waves, rather than interfering waves. This includes normal wave properties and equations, wave intensity, string waves, polarisation, sound waves (longitudinal waves) and the Doppler Effect. This is relatively easier than the next topic (Waves II) so uh yay thank god only this much is tested in the Common Test on Monday. Anyways yeah good luck, and let's see what comes out of this, right? Aight.
