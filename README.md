# Class Notes Version 2

We have been actively developing our website, and this is version 2. We shall be implementing quite a bit of notes here so please, stay tuned.

## Contributions Guide
1. Clone the repository on [our Class' GitHub Organization Page](https://github.com/M22504/class-notes-v2).
2. Run `setup.sh` or `setup.cmd`.
3. Open `/doc` on your Markdown editor (suggestion: use Obsidian or Vim) and make your changes.
4. If you created a new directory or file, make sure to add it to `mkdocs.yml` so it knows it's there.
5. To deploy the site, go to the root directory and run either `deploy.sh` or `deploy.cmd` via the difference command lines (PowerShell Support coming soon).
6. Remember to push whatever changes you've made so that they don't get erased.
